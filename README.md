# Inverted Index & Search Tree Comparative Study

> Final project â€“ FGV/EMAp â€“ Data Structures & Algorithms *(2025)*

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-lightgrey)](#)

A **workâ€‘inâ€‘progress** codebase that will implement and compare three classic searchâ€‘tree data structuresâ€”**BST**, **AVL**, and **Redâ€‘Black Tree**â€”as backâ€‘ends for an inverted index over textual documents.  The heavy theoretical details live in our ðŸ’¼ `report.pdf`;

## Project Overview

Huge docs, even bigger trees.  We will:

* parse a corpus of text files into tokens;

* build an **inverted index** using three searching structures (BST/AVL/RBT);

* expose a minimal **commandâ€‘line interface** for indexing & search;

* collect timing / memory metrics and present a comparative analysis.

See [`report.pdf`](./report.pdf) for the full problem statement and planned methodology.

*This section will stay short on purpose.*

## Benchmarking

*Being worked on*

Performance harness powered by **matplotlib** plots.

---

## Branching & Workflow

We follow a **trunkâ€‘based with topics** strategy:

* `main` â€“ stable.
* `feature/<scope>` â€“ atomic features
* `test/<scope>` â€“ dedicated test suites
* `documentation/<scope>` â€“ documentation & report tweaks.

> Pull requests must pass *all* checks before merging.  *Being worked on*

## Documentation & Report

Full theoretical background, design decisions, and result discussion live in `report.pdf`.  This README will **only** host the practical howâ€‘tos.
